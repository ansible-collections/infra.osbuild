# Blueprint examples for RHEL image builder

This collection of blueprints serve as proof-of-concept examples for popular application workloads and use cases.  The intent is to help users get started quickly, reducing the amount of technical debt to research and create this on their own.

Each blueprint can be used individually, or inspected and combined to assemble your own highly optimized blueprint for your needs.
