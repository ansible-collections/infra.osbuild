minor_changes:
  - builder - created builder_pub_key_path for ssh key lookups
  - builder - builder_pub_key is for raw ssh keys
  - builder - use blueprint for builder_password not kickstart
  - builder - added enforce_auth to fail when no ssh key or password is defined. Can be set to false to bypass auth for image.
